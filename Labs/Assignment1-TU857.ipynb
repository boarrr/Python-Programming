    "Create an algorithm that reads in a series of positive integers (i.e., whole numbers greater than or equal to one) from the user. Count the number of entered integers over 50 and the total number of integers entered. The user should enter the number zero to indicate that they have finished entering integers. The number zero should not be included in the count of integers entered. Use a loop in the algorithm. Do not use a break statement to end the loop."

When the number is guessed the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively. Use a loop in the algorithm.
